# Password Generator 

## Purpose
A website that provides a randomly generated password following user set criteria. The criteria include:
password length
character types included (lowercase, uppercase, #, special characters)

These criteria will be set in a series of window prompts. After the user selects the desired criteria the input should be validated. Currently there are two validation points one is after the determining the password length and the other is after the last character prompt. The validation after the password length looks to see if the password length is valid (between 8 and 128). If it is not it displays an alert and tells the user to make a valid selection. The validation after character type selection makes sure that at least one charater type was selected, if not they are asked to make at least one selection. 

After the criteria has been set by the user a password is displayed in the text area. Clicking the generate password button again allow the user to select different criteria.
